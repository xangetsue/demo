                <pre>From EW, October 21, 1994 [TV Show Review: Winning “Friends”]:</pre>

                    <p>Monica (Courteney Cox) is our primary character because — well, because Courteney Cox is the biggest name-brand star in this show. Monica is an assistant chef in a Manhattan restaurant, has a sunny nature, and radiates common sense; she’s the solid center in a circle of wacky pals. Among these is Monica’s roommate, Rachel (Jennifer Aniston), who is a scatterbrained waitress at the coffeehouse where all the friends hang out. Across the hall from Monica and Rachel’s apartment live Chandler (Matthew Perry) and Joey (Matt LeBlanc): nice, macho, dumb guys. Then there’s Ross, Monica’s brother, played by David Schwimmer, best known as the doomed ”4B” on last season’s NYPD Blue. I don’t know where Ross lives. In fact, it took me two weeks to figure out that he was Monica’s brother and not her lover. (Speaking on behalf of other, possibly equally baffled viewers, I’d suggest to Schwimmer that he resist the thoroughly understandable temptation to hug Cox in quite so passionate a manner.) And finally, there is Phoebe (Lisa Kudrow) — again, who knows where she’s from, but she’s even more scatterbrained than Rachel, and, as if I weren’t confused enough, is just a variation on the ditsy-waitress character Kudrow continues to play on Mad About You. Excuse me while I catch my breath.</p>
                    
                    <pre>From the New York Times, September 29, 1994 [TELEVISION REVIEW; Yes, More Friends Sitting Around]:</pre>
                    
                    <p>Oh, no, you might well moan, not another group of pals sitting around whining and nursing their anxieties, getting up once in a while to test the passing Zeitgeist. Oh, yes. But click into NBC’s “Friends” anyway. The creators and executive producers are Marta Kauffman and David Crane, whose “Dream On” has been exploring new boundaries of zaniness (and permissiveness) on HBO. “Friends,” more conventional on the surface, promises to be equally offbeat and seductive.
                    … The cast is appealing, the dialogue is pitch-perfect 1994, the time-slot is between the solidly established “Mad About You” at 8 P.M. and “Seinfeld” at 9 P.M. “Friends” comes as close as a new series can get to having everything.</p>
                    
                    <pre>From the L.A. Times, September 22, 1994 [TV Reviews : NBC’s Strongest Evening of the Week Has Its Weak Spot (that’s actually about Madman of the People)]:</pre>
                    
                    <p>.. Given that the cafe and apartment look somewhat alike — and that the schmoozing and blizzard of acerbic one-liners occur in both places — juxtaposing these locales gets confusing. And the notion that all of these attractive people would remain platonic while flopping around together is a bit far-fetched. Yet these are nit-picks, and “Friends” has so many good moves that there’s really nothing to dislike. It’s all so light and frothy that after each episode you may be hard-pressed to recall precisely what went on, except that you laughed a lot.</p>
                    
                    <pre>From USA Today, September 22, 1994 [not archived online]:</pre>
                    
                    <p>No one seems to have anything better to do than swill cappuccino at a plush hangout or sit around Cox’s place watching bad TV (“Oh, I think this is the episode of Three’s Company where there’s some kind of misunderstanding,” Perry ironically jokes).</p>
                    
                    <pre>From People, October 3, 1994 [Picks and Pans]:</pre>
                    
                    <p>… The scripts are filled with pop references — e.g., gags about David Hasselhoff, Shari Lewis and Mentos mints.
                    A game cast delivers the barrage of banter with an arch coyness that suggests they think they’re in some Gen X Neil Simon play.</p>
